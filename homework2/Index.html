            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>To move your little character, all you have to do is <strong>slide your finger</strong> in the direction in which you want to go. He will move in that direction until he runs into an obstacle, at which point he will stop and you can slide your finger in another direction to keep moving.<br><br>In Tomb of the Mask, you'll find two main game modes. In the <strong>arcade mode</strong>, you'll have to keep making your way through a dungeon until you inevitably die in a trap... or drown in the water that's rising from the bottom of the screen. In the <strong>level mode</strong>, however, you'll play through smaller and more condensed scenarios that you can finish in just a few seconds.<br><br><em>Tomb of the Mask</em> is an outstanding game that combines a gameplay perfectly adapted for touch screens with an old-school difficulty. The visual style is inspired by video games from Spectrum and puts the icing on the cake in this authentic neo-retro wonder.</p>
